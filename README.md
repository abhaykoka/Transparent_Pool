Transparent Pool is an Android application designed to offer a clear and open solution for the seamless operation of collective pools. The app empowers pool members by providing real-time visibility into the current financial standing of the pool, along with a comprehensive transaction log detailing every financial move made by the pool handler in pursuit of the pool's objectives. This transparency ensures that all members can easily track the funds within the pool and stay informed about every transaction made to support the collective goals.

This collaborative project, named Transparent Pool, is a joint effort between myself and my classmate, L. Satyalokesh. Developed using Android Studio HedgeHog, the frontend is crafted with XML and Java to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience. As for the backend, we have seamlessly integrated Back4U to power the functionality of the application. Together, our expertise and teamwork have contributed to the creation of a transparent and efficient solution for managing collective pools on the Android platform.
